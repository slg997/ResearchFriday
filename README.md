# #ResearchFriday
The purpose of #ResearchFriday is help defenders to build network sensors to learn, test and profile attack tools and techniques in a safe and controlled environment.

Network artefacts that could be then extracted and used to proactively search for, hunt or compile custom signatures in your own network.

## Why?
Attack tools and techniques evolve constantly and as a defender we should try to keep pace with changes and also it is fun to learn!

## Requirement
* Virtualisation Software (Oracle VirtualBox is a good choice)
* Security Onion (https://securityonion.net) - Fantastic Open Source Swiss Army Knife of security monitoring, sensors and tools
* Moloch (https://molo.ch) - Full IPv4 packet capture 
* Nginx (https://www.nginx.com) - Load Balancer, Reverse Proxy
* Docker (https://www.docker.com) - An open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications
