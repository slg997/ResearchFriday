# #ResearchFriday

The purpose of #ResearchFriday is help defenders to build network sensors to learn, test and profile attack tools and techniques in a safe and controlled environment.

Network artefacts that could be then extracted and used to proactively search for, hunt or compile custom IDS signatures in your own network.

## Why?

Attack tools and techniques evolve constantly and as a defender we should try to keep pace with changes and also it is fun to learn!
